A Ruby library that generates GitHub-like [identicons](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons)

## Installing

That's easy! Use [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org)!

Insert `Identicon` on your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
    gem 'identicon'
```
and run

    $ bundle

or manually install it typing

    $ gem install identicon

and hitting `return` with your favourite finger.




## Using

Require it as always
```ruby
    require 'identicon'
```
Now you can use it through two methods: `data_url_for` or `file_for`. Simple like that.

## `data_url_for`
This generates a data-url, so you can use it immediately, check it out:
```ruby
    Identicon.data_url_for "Whatever you want!"
```
You can also specify a image size and a background color:
```ruby
    Identicon.data_url_for "Whatever you want!", 128, [255, 255, 255]
```
This creates a 128x128px image, with a nice white background.

    – But Vito, I want to save it as a file.
    – No problemo! fil_for is the way to go.

# `file_for`
This generates and writes the result to a file. It's as easy as just making a data-url. Check it out:
```ruby
    Identicon.file_for "User's email? Username? Telephone?", "/path/to/the/image"
```
And, as you may guess, it also takes those optional parameters.
```ruby
    Identicon.file_for "User's email? Username? Telephone?", "/path/to/the/image", 128, [255, 255, 255]
```
